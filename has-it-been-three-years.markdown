[007](http://masak.github.io/007/), the toy language, is turning three today. Whoa.

On its one-year anniversary, I wrote [a blog post](http://strangelyconsistent.org/blog/double-oh-seven) to chronicle it. It seriously doesn't feel like two years since I wrote that post.

On and off, in between long stretches of just being a parent, I come back to 007 and work intensely on it. I can't remember ever keeping a side project alive for three years before. (*Later note*: Referring to the language here, not my son.) So there is that.

So in a weird way, even though the language is not as far along as I would expect it to be after three years, I'm also positively surprised that it still *exists* and is *active* after three years!

In the previous blog post, I proudly announce that "We're gearing up to an (internal) v1.0.0 release". Well, we're *still* gearing up for v1.0.0, and we are closer to it. The details are in [the roadmap](https://github.com/masak/007/blob/master/ROADMAP.md), which has become much more detailed since then.

Things that I'm looking forward to right now:

* Landing `macro infix:<ff>` in `master`, which is quite literally one small fix away at this point.
* Landing [a huge object system refactor](https://github.com/masak/007/pull/242) that really cleans up the language.
* `is parsed`, also only a few steps away.
* Making a better web site, focused around language tutorials and API documentation.
* Writing a 007 parser in pure 007.

I tried to write those in increasing order of difficulty.

All in all, I'm quite eager to one day burst into `#perl6` or `#perl6-dev` and actually showcase examples where macros quite *clearly* do useful, non-trivial things. 007 is and has always been about producing such examples, and making them run in a real (if toy) environment.

And while we're not quite over that hump yet, we're perceptibly closer than we were two years ago.
