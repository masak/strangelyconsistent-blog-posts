A while ago, I [applied for a Hague grant to give Rakudo macros](http://news.perlfoundation.org/2011/09/hague-grant-application-implem.html). It has now been [accepted](http://news.perlfoundation.org/2011/11/hague-grant-accepted-implement.html). My reaction:

Yay! \o/

I haven't blogged much lately, and I suspect it might be because my blogging plans are to ambitious to fit in my fragmented schedule. So I'll stop here. But expect the first status report of the grant soonish.
